#### Navbar consists of a straightforward user interface where there is a

- **Navigation bar** with an SVG image logo *Coding Addict*, a list of hyperlinks to other pages and social media sites.
- Page links i.e. `Home` is set to the homepage and other pages have not been set with any data i.e., `About` , `Projects` , `Contact` , `Profile` but **Netlify** handles them as *Page not Found*. Social Media icons have been set to route to their respective official sites.
- Data is handled by **`data.js`** and styles are handled by **`index.css`**
- To run the project locally, clone the repo, `npm install` to install the dependencies, and `npm start` to start up the development server on default port 3000.
